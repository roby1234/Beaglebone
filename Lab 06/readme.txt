================================================
I've seen several ReadMe's that look just like yours.  Did you write the original?
I've also see several joystick.js's that look like yours. Did you write the original?
If so, I'll give you full credit.

Lab06 aims at controlling various devices like leds, led matrix and E-A-S program using Joystick and reading values using a rotary encoder.
	
The Joystick consists of four potentiometers attached to its base. As the Joystick moves in a particular direction, the potentiometers are rotated and the values are altered leading to a change in the positioning of the joystick as read by the Beaglebone.Based on the readings obtained these devices are controlled. 
	
This lab made us get familiarized with the joystick, which is a basic device used in many places. But the devices controlled were quite common. It would have been better if we operated something new with the joystick.
