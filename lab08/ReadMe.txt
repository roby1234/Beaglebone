Lab 08 was about working with LKMs (Loadable Kernel Modules). Initial setup instructions were obtained from Derek Molloy's blog (http://derekmolloy.ie/writing-a-linux-kernel-module-part-1-introduction/)

In the first part, the LKM from the above blog was loaded onto the BeagleBone. Output was tested and recorded in /var/ker.log.

In the second part, some modifications were made to the original file to make a new one:
1) Added the lab partners as authors.
2) Added new parameter addr to show address, with default value as "IIT"
3) Print address to ker.log file.
4) Added hello2.o to the makefile to compile it alongwith the hello.c file

Since we were completely new to messing around with kernel files and modules, it was something difficult for both of us. We learnt some of the 'deep and messy stuff' in Linux.
